      <p> Education is vital to succeed in society today, but not everyone has the same advantages and opportunities. Based on your gender, race/ethnicity,  income level, and disability status; you may not be so lucky. </p>

  <p> Diversity is important in schools. Depending on where a student lives or how much their family makes, it can impact the level of education they receive. The level of opportunities given to students can be determined by their socioeconomic status and how they identify. The education system is unfair because if a student lives in a geographical location that averages a lower income, their education is not as valued because there are not many programs and care funded by the government. Unfortunately, often-times these students that attend schools with less funding and resources are students of color and students with emotional and physical disabilities.</p>

  <p> In New York State, the Department of Education (DOE) is the hub of all resources, production and administering public schools statewide. The DOE creates policies and programs to implement in schools and produces standardized testing, state tests, and regents examinations. </p>

  <p>South Richmond High School in Staten Island, New York, is a perfect example of a community of students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds with parents that make a lower income, and how their education is impacted. As this school is made for students who are also emotionally disturbed, it takes a team of educators who want to dedicate their time to helping these students. Guidance Counselor Ivette Morales, is committed to developing a personalized relationship with her students, and makes it a key goal of hers to highlight their identities (such as race, gender, and sexuality) and celebrate their accomplishments to make them feel like they are receiving the same treatment other privileged students have on a daily basis. Morales’ job is to help students reach their optimal level of psychological functioning through resolving negative patterns, and to provide individual and group counseling. As an employee for District 75, a non-geographic district, she works hard to provide quality and rigorous individualized educational programs to students with significant challenges. District 75 (D75) provides citywide educational, vocational, and behavior support programs for students who are on the autism spectrum, have significant cognitive delays, and are severely emotionally challenged, sensory impaired and/or multiply disabled. </p>


  <p>Examining how these students perform on standardized tests and SAT’s compared to other students is challenging. “First, District 75 scores are (always) exceptionally low on the SAT’s and do not seem to follow the same distribution as other schools’ scores. Second, there is for whatever reason no data for District 75 schools f0r 2019, 2020, and 2021. NYC stopped including their results, but for whatever reason the D75 should not be included in further analysis,” said Morales. It seems like New York State is trying to cover their tracks when reporting on these students, and maybe it is to skew their overall data analysis to make it look better.</p>



  <p> In New York State, it is a requirement to graduate high school with a regents diploma. The Regents are statewide exams in core high school course subjects. For South Richmond High School students, who have a literacy disadvantage, it takes longer for them to complete their high school degree. External factors, like the Covid-19 pandemic, made it even more difficult to gain insight into how these students were performing, “During the pandemic D75 had a ratio of graduating students 15 to 15, not the case before covid. Current students are considered pandemic graduates because they had their regents exams waived,” said Morales</p>


  <p> Students from lower income families perform lower and drop out of school at a faster rate than students from families that have higher incomes. “Low-income families and communities have less resources available than the communities of high-income levels. Standardized testing has played a role when it comes to the academic performance and overall achievement of low-income families,” said Morales. </p>


  <p> As a woman of color, Morales strives to represent, support, and protect students of color. She understands the implications that race and ethnicity have on societal structures. She is aware that these students may be treated differently due to biases because of their identity. “Black and Latino student’s graduation rate is definitely much lower than the graduating rate of white students in D75. The students from lower income homes skip over college and go straight to work,” said Morales.</p>
